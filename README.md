# Tetris_Unity_C-Sharp

I created this game using Unity and C#. I have played Tetris a lot, and thought it would be a fun challenge to create the game myself.

#### Features of the game:
- Player can move blocks left and right.
- Player can rotate the block by pressing the up key.
- Player can send the block directly down as far as it can go by pressing the down key.
- The block will not move outside of the grid.
- When a line is completed, that line disappears, and the blocks above it move down to fill the gap.
- Player's score and Level are shown on the right hand side.
- An image of the next shape that will appear is shown on the right hand side.

#### To play:
Clone this repository, and open 'Standalone Build'.
